<h1>Digital Freedom across the World - Country Comparison</h1>
<p>I'm aware that this is probably going to be the most controversial article on this site and I deliberately want it to be the most polemic one. Some misguided individuals may insist that encryption is bad because it's just used by criminals and nonces and if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear, that we can't protect children from harm unless VPNs are banned, that courts ordering websites to be blocked is okay because - for now - it's mostly just affecting pirate sites plundering from starving Hollywood execs, or that freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom from consequences and doubleplusungood ideas are threatening our democracy or something.<br /><br />

The aim of this piece is to see what restrictions and freedoms for the Internet and computing in general are in place across the world. Besides just being an interesting study, there's also real-world utility: Where can you host a website without disclosing your name and adress? What country should you select for your VPN server? In which country will you not need to worry about the police kicking in your front door at 4 am because they didn't like a joke you made on social media?<br /><br />

What this is <em>not</em> is a general comparison of a country's freedom. I'm not looking at the freedom of press, at the election system, or at how libertarian a country is when it comes to guns, sex, or tax. This is purely a look at the digital realm.<br /><br />

I am comparing a carefully selected list of only a few countries; it would be great to compare all ~200 countries of the world but it is an impossible task. I have included the G7 countries (US, Canada, UK, Germany, France, Italy, Japan) and the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) and also Australia in order to honour them for being the first Western country to stop pretending they care about privacy or freedom. I also added Switzerland and Iceland because they always come up in all those lists of what the best countries for privacy and VPNs are - so let's put them to the test.<br /><br />

Of course, there's many more countries in the world and many of them are lauded for their freedoms and protections from government overreach, for example I've heard good things about the Netherlands, Norway, Estonia, and Panama. But it's impossible to diligently compare all countries and there is no clear indication that I'm really missing out a hidden champion - a brief research shows that they all have some restrictions in this or that category. A final thought: for now, you might be able to find lots of freedom in a poor country with low Internet penetration where the government has better things to do than policing the web or isn't able to comprehensively enforce its laws. Why not host your VPS in Papua New Guinea, Transnistria, or Somaliland?</p>


<details><summary><strong>Disclaimer regarding free speech</strong></summary>
<p>To avoid misunderstandings, I would like to clarify that while I personally do not endorse any form of e.g. hate speech or discrimination, I believe in the principle that most speech and opinions should be legal, including speech that may be considered offensive or bigoted. Such speech should be countered with more speech and with dialogue, rather than through government censorship or legal penalties. I believe that government punishment of certain speech is ultimately damaging to democratic discourse, as hate speech laws tend to be very vague and can therefore potentially be misused by authoritarian governments to suppress dissent and limit free expression.
<br /><br />
To give some more examples:</p>
<ul>
	<li>I strongly disagree with discriminating or otherwise judging people based on their innate or immutable characteristics, such as ethnicity, sex, disability etc. However, I don't believe it should be the government's business to prosecute people for such speech, especially if the laws are worded very vaguely or if courts apply them unevenly and unpredictably. If even jokes or 'likes' on social media can potentially result in punishment, it means the only way to be safe from prosecution is to be quiet, and I believe that this will lead to self-censorship and fear of accidentally saying something that could be illegal, which ultimately harms democracy.</li>
	<li>I don't think it's good to insult people's religious feelings, but I am opposed to the idea that religions should have privileged protections and that criticising religions should be something that can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.S._v._Austria_(2018)" target="_blank">potentially illegal</a>.</li>
	<li>I don't deny that the Holocaust happened, but I find it odd how some countries have specifically banned its denial, while at the same time it's often legal to deny other genocides. I think it can actually have the opposite effect, with people starting to wonder "why can't I say this? they must be hiding something!" In general, I disagree with laws that ban fringe theories on history - imagine if it was illegal to deny the moon landing or the Berlin wall or that something notable happened in 1989 on a big square in China's Northern Capital? These things are easy to prove and there is no need to jail people for saying things that can be easily countered with arguments.</li>
	<li>I don't think insulting people is good, but I don't think it should be illegal, and I especially don't think that politicians or the head of state should be privileged in that regard; especially if it's not clearly defined what actually constitutes an insult<!-- and when even <a href="https://weltwoche.ch/daily/deutsche-staatsanwaltschaft-jagt-blogger-der-vorwurf-er-habe-ricarda-lang-chefin-der-deutschen-gruenen-als-dick-bezeichnet-nun-wurde-ihm-auch-das-bankkonto-gesperrt/" target="_blank">calling a politician "fat"</a> can potentially get you in trouble-->. Likewise, I think misgendering people on purpose is mean and offensive, but I don't believe that it is something the government should get involved in (e.g. German Selbstbestimmungsgesetz providing for a penalty of up to €10,000).</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, I believe that speech is either entirely free or not at all; once exceptions are introduced, even with good intentions, free speech ceases to exist. I also believe that free speech is a good thing and a that a democratic and open society cannot exist without it, even if is sometimes leads to discomfort or offense.</p>

These include obscenity, which must meet the Miller test by appealing to prurient interests, depicting sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and lacking serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. Speech that constitutes fraud, child pornography, or is integral to illegal conduct is also unprotected. Additionally, speech that incites imminent lawless action, as established by the Brandenburg test, is not protected, meaning advocacy for violence or illegal acts is only punishable if it is directed at producing imminent lawless action and is likely to do so.<br /><br />Other unprotected categories include true threats, which involve serious expressions of intent to commit unlawful violence against a person or group, and "fighting words" that are likely to provoke an immediate violent response from an average person.<br /><br />False statements of fact made with actual malice or negligence can lead to liability in defamation cases, especially when they harm a person's reputation. Lying under oath (perjury) or making false statements to federal investigators is also criminal and unprotected. Commercial speech, such as advertising, receives diminished protection, and false or misleading advertising can be punished.<br /><br />Hate speech, while often offensive, is generally protected under the First Amendment unless it falls into one of the unprotected categories like true threats or incitement to violence. The government may regulate speech in specific contexts, such as broadcasting indecent language on public airwaves, which the FCC can fine under certain conditions. Intellectual property violations, such as copyright infringement or counterfeiting currency, also constitute illegal speech under relevant laws.</span></span><br />

Proponents argue it is not censorship because a new (American) owner of TikTok would still be allowed to circulate the same content.<br />- <strong>Stop Hiding Hate Act (New York)</strong>: Forces social media platforms to report 'hate speech' incidents; while no fines for retaining legal content are imposed, it may coerce platforms into more aggressive moderation practices.</details></td>

Speech crimes in general are very difficult to convict in Iceland because the courts have to prove that restricting the speech is "necessary and in accordance with democratic traditions". The state cannot initiate a prosecution, a private individual has to report it first. In total, about 30 people have been found guilty of insults in Iceland in as many years. in every case the punishment is simply to have your insult officially declared "dead and worthless."

<h3>Want to add more countries?</h3>

<p>Of course I'd love to compare as many countries as possible, but it's a lot of work. Not only the initial research but especially keeping everything up to date and being aware of new developments and law proposals. Therefore, I do not currently plan to add any more countries myself. However, if you want to add another country, I'd be happy to include your contribution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contribute via pull request on Github (ensure that the "Allow edits from maintainers" option is enabled when creating the pull request), or if you don't want to create a Github account or don't know HTML, then you can send me an email.</li>
<li>Required content: a "summary" (the part that's always visible) which should be very short (every row should have the same height); some details (the part that's collapsed and hidden by default) which should be as long as needed but as short as possible and should mention the names of laws where relevant; a suggested "colour" for the table cell</li>
<li>It should be "ready to publish", no more research needed from my side; please also give me some sources for fact-checking</li>
<li>The next countries to be added should be important countries (e.g. large population, big economy, regional power) <strong>or</strong> it can be a small country which is a "hidden champion" when it comes to digital freedom (like Iceland). Some relevant countries to include might be: <em>Argentina, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Pakistan, Poland, Saudi-Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, Turkey, UAE</em></li>
<li>I would be very grateful if you could keep updating "your" country whenever the situation changes, to reduce the ongoing maintenance burden for me.</li>
</ul>

<h2>So, what's the conclusion?</h2>

<p>Despite the ever-present moaning about the US allegedly slipping into tyranny or the (merited) worries that every byte of data on American servers can be accessed by the NSA and CIA, <strong>the legal protections in the US are still strongest of all the countries I looked at and probably worldwide</strong>. There's always some ifs and buts, for example the age verification that's now mandatory in many US states (but not federally), but overall the US does quite well, with the biggest relative strength being free speech. Other countries with a high degree of freedom in the digital realm are <strong>Canada, Iceland, and Japan</strong>. Unsurprisingly, China is the least free. But it's also very disappointing to see how "red" many Western countries appear, especially when you consider all the further restrictions that are currently proposed or in preparation. Interestingly, censorship in Western countries happens indirectly, by forcing private companies to do the censoring and blocking (cf. NetzDG, OSA) so that the lawmakers can keep pretending that it's not <em>real</em> censorship.</p>

<h4>Don't be afraid to be an old man yelling at clouds</h4>

<p>There is not much we can do as individuals, ultimately. Maybe those of us who are lucky enough to live in a democracy need to vote harder next time or sign another petition :^) Even when the noose gets tightened more and more, we should always try to opt out of government and corporate overreach wherever we still can. And make no mistake: even though Big Tech companies sometimes make a stand against the most malicious laws, that doesn't automatically make them the "good guys" either.<br /><br />
