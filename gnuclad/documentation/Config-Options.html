<h2 class="chapter">4 Config Options</h2>

<h3 class="section">4.1 Default settings</h3>

<p>Every config option has a preset default which will be used if there is no
override. 
In the same spirit, a default configuration will be used if you specify no
config file.

<h3 class="section">4.2 Generate a config file</h3>

<p>You can always generate a full configuration file by specifying CONF as
gnuclad's output:
<pre class="example">     
     gnuclad input.csv CONF
     gnuclad input.csv config-file.conf
     gnuclad input.csv conf another.conf
</pre>
   <p>The last line will use the settings as available from 'another.conf' and
complement them with the built-in defaults. 
The 'input.csv' will be ignored. It can be an empty dummy file.
