<h1>EU of Regions after Right-Wing Takeover</h1>
<h2>How the European Union could look like</h2>

<p style="color: red; font-size: small;">Last updated: 2017</p>

<p>This map shows a "Europe of Regions" and how it could look after right-wing populists come into power in the EU but then decide to keep the EU alive instead of abolishing it. I would imagine that there would be apartheid and discrimination against Muslims.<br /><br />
The picture assumes a possible Federal Republic of Europe that has abolished the old national borders and introduced regions, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.The picture also shows the (co-)official languages and capitals of each region, the overseas possessions of Europe, and implies a voting system of proportional representation and well as some remigration of foreigners into their home countries and designated international cities. There is also an implied steering towards Russia, and tenser relations to the US and especially Turkey.</p>
