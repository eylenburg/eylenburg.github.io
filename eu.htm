<h1>Idea for an EU of Regions</h1>
<h2>How the European Union could look like</h2>

<p style="color: red; font-size: small;">Last updated: 2017</p>

<p>This map shows the "Europe of Regions" that is one proposed future of the EU. It assumes a possible Federal Republic of Europe that has abolished the old national borders and introduced regions, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.<br /><br />
The picture also shows the (co-)official languages and capitals of each region, the overseas possessions of Europe, and implies a voting system of proportional representation and well as some kind of right-wing revolution leading to remigration of foreigners into their home countries and designated international cities. There is also an implied steering towards Russia, and tenser relations to the US and especially Turkey.</p>
