<h1>What would the World look like if the Axis had won WW2?</h1>
<h2>What if National Socialist Germany and Imperial Japan had been victorious?</h2>

<p>It seems to be a common question - both for people interested in history and everyone else - to wonder what would have happened if the Axis had won World War 2. In this map, I have included the actual plans of the German and Japanese governments on how to divide the world after victory. This "New World Order" is not based on my own ideas, but on actual plans.<br /><br />
These plans also included the British Empire joining the Axis (as the Nazis always wanted them to do) and a later betrayal of Italy and annexation of some northern regions deemed Germanic. Interestingly, it seems that there haven't been any plans to conquer the USA, which the Nazis deemed "half Jewified, half Negrified" and probably too far away too physically occupy.<br /><br />
The map as a whole looks a bit ridiculous with two medium-sized countries jointly ruling most of the world, but then again the cold war was also characterized by two worldwide blocs being led by two not-super-big countries (in terms of population).<br /><br />

If you spot any factual error in my map or have any other kind of feedback, please leave a comment.</p>
