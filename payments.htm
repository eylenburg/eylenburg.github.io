<h1>Comparison of Payment Methods (and Cryptocurrencies)</h1>
<p>This is comparison of various payment methods. In my opinion the most important aspects are: (1) privacy, (2) fungibility and resilience to censorship and expropriation, (3) day-to-day convenience and acceptance.</p>

<h2>So, what's the conclusion?</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>&rarr; Use Monero if you can. &larr;</strong> Monero comes close to being the digital equivalent of cash - decentralized, uncontrollable, private. We need to make sure it can be used everywhere, not just in darknet markets or for buying VPNs and donating to piracy websites. We also need to establish decentralized, trustless, KYC-free ways to exchange fiat to Monero and back.</li>
<li><strong>&rarr; Pay in cash in physical shops. &larr;</strong> The more cash is used, the harder it will be for governments and companies to kill it.</li>
<li>Resist your government if they try to phase out cash, introduce CBDCs, or attempt to suffocate cryptocurrency use with punitive KYC regulations. <strong>CBDCs = financial totalitarianism.</strong></li>
<li>Bitcoin - the first cryptocurrency - has ultimately failed to become a viable payment method. <em>Lightning</em> won't be the solution for Bitcoin's scalability and privacy problems either: <a href="https://ioradio.org/i/ln/" target="_blank">[1]<a> <a href="https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/ln-blackpill/" target="_blank">[2]</a> <a href="https://decrypt.co/25800/wallet-balances-on-bitcoins-lightning-network-arent-private-new-report-says" target="_blank">[3]</a> <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoReality/comments/rzp2oq/a_critical_review_of_the_lightning_network/" target="_blank">[4]</a> <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/04/02/are-bitcoin-developers-losing-faith-in-lightning/" target="_blank">[5]</a>.</li>

<h3>How to get Monero?</h3>
<p>There are numerous centralized exchanges (CEX) as well as P2P marketplaces where you can buy and sell Monero. Some of them require identifying yourself (KYC) to comply with anti-money laundering regulations. However, due to Monero's privacy features, the only thing known to the seller is <em>that</em> you bought Monero, but not how much you own or where you spend it. Some reputable places to buy Monero include:

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://reto-swap.com/" target="_blank">RetoSwap</a></strong> (formerly known as Haveno-Reto) is a non-custodial, decentralized P2P exchange platform based on the Havenoapplication which is available for Linux, Windows, and macOS. Monero can be bought and sold with maximum privacy, as there are no KYC requirements, trades are made directly between users (peer-to-peer), and all connections run through the Tor network. It is possible to buy Monero via bank transfer, Paypal, or even by paying in cash (meeting in person or sending by mail). Arbitrators can step in to resolve disputes between buyer and seller.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.kraken.com" target="_blank">Kraken</a></strong>: A well-known CEX. Registration and KYC are mandatory. Card payments and bank transfers accepted. Make sure not to leave your newly purchased Moneros on Kraken's platform after the purchase but to withdraw them to a non-custodial wallet. <br /><span style="color: grey;">Please note that Kraken does <strong>not</strong> allow the purchase of Monero from these countries (as of November 2024): European Union member countries, United Kingdom, Norway, Iceland, Russia, Belarus; Japan, North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan; Australia; Cuba; DR Congo <a href="https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001368823-Where-can-I-use-Kraken-" target="_blank">[1]</a> <a href="https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/support-for-monero-xmr-in-europe" target="_blank">[2]</a></span></li>
