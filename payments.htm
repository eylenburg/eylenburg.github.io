<h1>Comparison of Payment Methods (and Cryptocurrencies)</h1>
<p>This is comparison of various payment methods. In my opinion the most important aspects are: (1) privacy, (2) fungibility and resilience to censorship and expropriation, (3) day-to-day convenience and acceptance.</p>

<h2>So, what's the conclusion?</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>&rarr; Use Monero if you can. &larr;</strong> Monero comes close to being the digital equivalent of cash - decentralized, uncontrollable, private. We need to make sure it can be used everywhere, not just in darknet markets or for buying VPNs and donating to piracy websites. We also need to establish decentralized, trustless, KYC-free ways to exchange fiat to Monero and back.</li>
<li><strong>&rarr; Pay in cash in physical shops. &larr;</strong> The more cash is used, the harder it will be for governments and companies to kill it.</li>
<li>Resist your government if they try to phase out cash, introduce CBDCs, or attempt to suffocate cryptocurrency use with punitive KYC regulations. <strong>CBDCs = financial totalitarianism.</strong></li>
<li>Bitcoin - the first cryptocurrency - has ultimately failed to become a viable payment method. <em>Lightning</em> won't be the solution for Bitcoin's scalability and privacy problems either: <a href="https://ioradio.org/i/ln/" target="_blank">[1]<a> <a href="https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/ln-blackpill/" target="_blank">[2]</a> <a href="https://decrypt.co/25800/wallet-balances-on-bitcoins-lightning-network-arent-private-new-report-says" target="_blank">[3]</a> <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoReality/comments/rzp2oq/a_critical_review_of_the_lightning_network/" target="_blank">[4]</a> <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/04/02/are-bitcoin-developers-losing-faith-in-lightning/" target="_blank">[5]</a>.</li>

<h3>How to get Monero?</h3>
<p>There are numerous centralized exchanges (CEX) as well as P2P marketplaces where you can buy and sell Monero. Some of them require identifying yourself (KYC) to comply with anti-money laundering regulations. However, due to Monero's privacy features, the only thing known to the seller is <em>that</em> you bought Monero, but not how much you own or where you spend it. Some reputable places to buy Monero include:
