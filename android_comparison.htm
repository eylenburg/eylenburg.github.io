<h1>Comparison of Android-based Operating Systems</h1>

<p>This is a comparison of popular Android "ROMs" (better term: AOSP distributions or Android-based OS). Please note I'm not affiliated with any of these projects and I am not giving any specific recommendation. If you think anything is factually incorrect, please let me know.</p>

<p>DivestOS was originally included in this comparison but it was discontinued at the end of 2024. <a href="old/android_comparison_2024old.htm"><strong>For an older version of this comparison which includes DivestOS, please see here.</a></strong></p>

To register, developers need to pay a fee and reveal their identity to Google. The only workaround to install apps from outside the Play Store from non-approved developers will be via <code>adb</code> (when connected to a PC or using Shizuku). These restrictions only apply to "certified" Google devices, i.e. those that have Play Services and Play Protect preinstalled, meaning it will not affect "custom ROMs" or Chinese phones. In November 2025, Google backpedalled and announced that they will be "building a new advanced flow that allows experienced users to accept the risks of installing software that isn't verified."</span></td>

<td class="legend tooltip">(Pixel only:) Force VoLTE, VoNR, 5G, VoWiFi<span class="tooltiptext">Previously, users of Pixel phones could change or set carrier network features like VoLTE (Voice over LTE), VoNR (Voice over New Radio, i.e. 5G voice), and WiFi Calling (VoWiFi), which is useful for users of imported Pixel phones in regions where these features are not supported. This carrier settings override was possible using <code>adb</code> shell commands or apps like Pixel IMS. With the December 2025 Android Security Bulletin patches (published in October 2025), Google removed support for these carrier override settings via <code>adb</code>, although <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-ims-update-fix-3606811/" target="_blank">as of 14 October 2025, the developer behind the Pixel IMS app has implemented a workaround</a>.<br /><br />Note that this was only possible on Pixel phones as they uniquely allowed this override because Google's implementation of the Android telephony framework granted higher-than-usual privileges to <code>adb</code> on Pixel devices. This was originally intended as a test and debugging mechanism for developers and engineers, making it possible to override carrier-related telephony settings through ADB commands. Google's decision to open this up for Pixels (until Q4 2024) was a quirk and it was never part of general Android policy or documentation for end users.</span></td>

These checks are about confirming the app is genuine and unmodified, but they are fundamentally anti-competitive as they enforce the use of Play Store linked to a Google account to download apps. While these checks purport to ensure app authenticity and security, they are fundamentally anti-competitive since they restrict users to obtaining apps only from the Play Store and require Google services licensing, thereby locking out alternative app sources or operating systems. Many apps use the Play Integrity API to block apps installed from alternative sources such as APK sideloads or Aurora Store, which harms user choice and fair competition. Disabling these checks can be useful for use apps that were "sideloaded", e.g. installed from Aurora Store or APK.</span></td>

This change in Google's policy delays getting patches to users and sophisticated attackers will have no issue getting the patches from one of many people at Android OEMs with early access.

<td class="legend tooltip">Security update speed (AOSP subset of ASB)<span class="tooltiptext">It doesn't explain how the device-specific patches in the second half of each Android Security Bulletin are actually delivered, or if they ever make it to end users. Since autumn 2025, Google no longer publishes all security fixes immediately into AOSP each month. Instead, they distribute patches under embargo to OEMs, and the corresponding changes only appear publicly in the source code 3–4 months later. This means that full security patching now depends even more on keeping up with your vendor's own releases, because relying on AOSP directly will always leave you months behind. Falling behind on quarterly or yearly OEM releases results in missing many security fixes until the next major release for that device. The situation varies greatly: Pixels still set the standard because Pixel updates track the embargoed patches promptly, while many vendors are slow to roll out quarterly or yearly releases. Some devices that fail to ship a timely new Android version make it almost impossible for an alternate OS to provide complete patches. If the vendor doesn't ship updated firmware or drivers, alternate OS projects have no path to apply those fixes themselves. For example, Fairphone historically trailed by 1–2 months even before the embargo change, and therefore projects like CalyxOS or LineageOS on Fairphone remain at least that far behind.<br /><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240328045058/https://divestos.org/misc/a-dates.txt" target="_blank" style="color: white;">Click here for update speed data</a></span></td>

<h3>Appendix 2: Which other alternative mobile operating systems are there?</h3>

<p>Besides <strong>Android</strong> and Android-based free &amp; open source operating systems (see the table above), the only <em>viable</em> alternative for most people is Apple's <strong>iOS</strong>. There have been many attempts to establish a third mobile OS, but so far none of them have been successful:

The below is a non-comprehensive list of mobile operating systems, both those you can try today and those that tried and failed in the past:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>iOS</strong></li>
<li>Using the Linux kernel:</li>
  <ul>
  <li>Not compatible with desktop GNU/Linux apps and each other, instead they each use their own app ecosystem:</li>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Android</strong>, both preinstalled proprietary distributions like Samsung's OneUI or Xiaomi's HyperOS, and open source forks of AOSP such as GrapheneOS <span class="foss">FOSS</span> or LineageOS <span class="foss">FOSS</span></li>
    <li><del>FirefoxOS</del> (&dagger; 2015) <span class="foss">FOSS</span></li>
      <ul><li><strong>KaiOS</strong></li></ul>
    <li><del>webOS</del> (&dagger; 2011) - This OS still is used in LG SmartTVs, but it's dead on phones.</li>
      <ul><li><strong>LuneOS</strong> <span class="foss">FOSS</span></li></ul>
    <li><del>Tizen</del> (&dagger; 2017) (successor of MeeGo, see below, but uses its own apps) - This OS still is used in Samsung SmartTVs, but it's dead on phones.</li>
    <li><strong>Sailfish OS</strong> (successor of MeeGo, see below, but uses its own apps)</li>
    <li><strong>Ubuntu Touch</strong> <span class="foss">FOSS</span> (experimental support for desktop Ubuntu apps (.deb and Snap) but normal Ubuntu Touch apps have the "Click" format which is not supported by any other Linux distributions)</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <ul>
  <li>Part of the main GNU/Linux ecosystem - can run desktop Linux apps and each other's apps:</li>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>postmarketOS</strong> <span class="foss">FOSS</span></li>
    <li>Various mobile distributions based on Debian GNU/Linux:</li>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Mobian</strong> <span class="foss">FOSS</span></li>
        <ul><li><strong>Droidian</strong> <span class="foss">FOSS</span></li></ul>
      <li><strong>PureOS</strong> <span class="foss">FOSS</span> (for the Librem 5 smartphone)</li>
      <li><strong>FuriOS</strong> <span class="foss">FOSS</span> (for the FuriPhone FLX series)</li>
      </ul>
    <li><del>Maemo</del> (&dagger; 2011) <span class="foss">FOSS</span></li>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Maemo Leste</strong> <span class="foss">FOSS</span></li>
        <li><del>MeeGo</del> (&dagger; 2012) <span class="foss">FOSS</span></li>
          <ul><li><strong>Nemo Mobile</strong> <span class="foss">FOSS</span></li></ul>
      </ul>
    <li>Linux distributions that are mainly focusing on PCs may also be available with a mobile UI, but they usually don't run on any smartphones due to missing hardware compatibility - <em>Fedora KDE Mobile Desktop</em> is one example. Rather, the focus is on other touchscreen devices such as tablets and 2-in-1 laptops that come preinstalled with Windows. Honourable mention goes to <strong>Manjaro ARM</strong> <span class="foss">FOSS</span> which was chosen as the default OS (with Plasma Mobile UI) for the Pinephone.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
<li><strong>HarmonyOS</strong> (Huawei's HarmonyOS has not been based on Android since the official launch of HarmonyOS NEXT in October 2024; it now uses its own microkernel and has its own app ecosystem)</li>
<li><del>Windows Pocket PC &rarr; Windows Mobile &rarr; Windows Phone &rarr; Windows 10 Mobile</del> (&dagger; 2020)</li>
<li><del>BlackBerry OS &rarr; BlackBerry 10</del> (&dagger; 2018)</li>
<li><del>Symbian</del> (&dagger; 2012)</li>
<li><del>Palm OS</del> (&dagger; 2007)</li>
</ul>

<p>Sailfish OS, Ubuntu Touch and FuriOS have integrated support for Android apps, though no full compatibility is guaranteed. Other Linux phones usually have the option of running Android apps via the Waydroid compatibility layer, if installed by the user.</p>
