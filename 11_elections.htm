<h1>Elections in 11 major countries from 1920 to 2020</h1>

<p>In this post I am showing the parliamentary seats held by the various political blocs across multiple nations from c.1920 to today.<br />
<br />
The graph only shows the parliamentary seats held in the lower house or legislative assembly. So in fact, it doesn't necessarily show only the democratic election results, but also the times of dictatorships.<br />
<br />
I looked at the following countries:</p>
<ul>
<li>United States</li>
<li>United Kingdom</li>
<li>Canada</li>
<li>Australia</li>
<li>European Union</li>
<li>Germany</li>
<li>France</li>
<li>Italy</li>
<li>Spain</li>
<li>Russia</li>
<li>Japan</li>
</ul>
<p>I grouped the parties into these blocs:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Far Left:</b> Anti-Democratic Anti-Capitalist parties of the Left (Communist, Marxist, Leninist, Stalinist, Maoist, Juche and Syndicalist parties)</li>
<li><b>Democratic Left: </b>Democratic parties of the Left (Social Democratic and Left-Liberal parties)</li>
<li><b>Democratic Center and Others: </b>Democratic parties of the Center (Conservative, Liberal, and Big-Tent parties), furthermore including  single-issue parties, independent MPs, foreign occupation, and transitional periods following dictatorships</li>
<li><b>Democratic Right: </b>Democratic parties of the Right (Nationalist and Right-Conservative parties)</li>
<li><b>Far Right: </b>Anti-Democratic Anti-Capitalist parties of the Right (Fascist, National Socialist, National Syndicalist, Falangist and Traditionalist parties)</li>
</ul>
<p>
The most striking finding is that the Anglo countries have not seen any extremist parties in parliament, which is probably due to their 'majority voting' (first past the post) systems.</p>
