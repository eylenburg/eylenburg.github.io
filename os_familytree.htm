<h1>Operating Systems: Timeline and Family Tree</h1>
<h2>Includes about 1,130 operating systems so far</h2>
<p style="color: red; font-size: small;">Last updated: April 2023</p>
<p>In this post you'll find a family tree and timeline of operating systems. I have tried to include all operating systems, no matter how old or obscure. Of course, a complete list is virtually impossible, as there is no way to catalogue all the tiny hobby and embedded systems that may exist somewhere.<br /><br />
Please also note that I only included a few selected Linux/BSD/Solaris distributions (it is arguable whether these should count as an OS on their own or not).<br /><br />
Currently, the family tree includes between around 1,120 different operating systems (including some renamings). Tip: use Ctrl+F (Cmd+F on Mac) to search for a system.</p>
